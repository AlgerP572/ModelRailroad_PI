		//28    WAIT_FOR_OUTSTANDING_WRITES; set to 1 and DMA will wait until peripheral says all writes have gone through before loading next CB

		//3     DREQ; copy of the data request signal from the peripheral, if DREQ is enabled. reads as 1 if data is being requested, else 0
		//2     INT; set when current CB ends and its INTEN=1. Write a 1 to this register to clear it
		//1     END; set when the transfer defined by current CB is complete. Write 1 to clear.
		//0     ACTIVE; write 1 to activate DMA (load the CB before hand)

		//12:15 BURST_LENGTH
		//11    SRC_IGNORE; set to 1 to not perform reads. Used to manually fill caches
